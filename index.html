            <p class="parragraph">Hi, I’m Rogel! I have gotten an AAS in Information Technology at LDS Business College.
                My interest for coding started from my Capstone project at the school, basically, I built a Web App to
                storage and stream videos with my own Linux server, SQL database, and PHP as my main code language. It
                was challenging and sometimes frustrating; however, I fishiched it!. I liked it so much that I wanted to
                learn more. </p>
            <P class="parragraph">At the present time, I’m taking a BootCamp for Full Stack Web Development at the
                University of Utah. It has been the most challenging class I have ever taken, but I’m so happy to be
                there. I have learned how to become a front and back web developer from HTML to React, databases, APIs,
                servers and more. I’m currently working on my final project and building a Web App to manage Telehealth
                devices from the local hospital. The idea comes up for the need to perform faster and more efficient
                monitoring and report for the Telehealth devices at the different hospital locations.</P>
            <p class="parragraph">My goal is to become a Computer Science Engineer and research for more efficient
                technology to support life. With my background in health care as a nurse and my new career in Computer
                Science are the perfect match and a great opportunity to develop more efficient technology for health
                care.</p>
